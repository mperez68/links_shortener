# Link Shortener

Link: https://bit.ly/3JJdLy3

This application is designed to complete the following requirements:

● A functioning web application with UI interfacing with API’s.
● User should be able to enter a long URL
  ○ Your system should save that URL and generate a short link
● Clicking on the short link should redirect a user to the original long URL
● User should be able to enter a long URL and a short link to create custom short link

 - The simple UI is self-explanatory: input your link in the given text box, press the button and, using the Bitly API, the application will generate (or fetch an existing) short link.
 - the Bitly API stores these links for future usage.
 - Unfortunately, Custom URL's are not available for the free version of Bitly that I am using.
